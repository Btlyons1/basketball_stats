# Basketball Statistics 

The notebooks in this repository are my own attempts to translate the R code snippets to Python from the Manning publiciations [statistics-slam-dunk](https://www.manning.com/books/statistics-slam-dunk) book.  

You can find the data sets and the R notebooks [here](https://github.com/garysutton/statisticsplaybook). 

All summaries and a large majority of text excerpts from the book.
